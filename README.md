Why Asterix? well * is an asterix or star. It is used in the old days of DOS as a wildcard, for file names,  by chance or someone elses kind thinking ahead, we are able to utilize it to scan files in a directory and pick out file types such as *.ogg or *.mp3 from filenames. Nothing to do with the cartoon character.
